DisplayTweet
============

This is a very simple plugin for the IRC bot "supybot".
It scans every written line in the channel if it contains the link to a Tweet and if such a link is found, then it calls the Twitter API to get the nickname, tweet text and date which then will be written to the channel.

Feel free to extend the plugin to support your custom status.net instances.

DISLAIMER:
Please note that this code comes without any warrenty, so use it at your own risk. 

REQUIREMENTS:
I'm sorry, but I did not investigate the detailled software requirements for this plugin. All I can say is that it should run under the current supybot version and it requires python-simplejson.
